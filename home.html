      	<p>World Changer Community want to be whole through its work. If you want something different you should start being yourself different. Change yourself, Change your community.How can you bring a change if you haven't been changed. Many years ago the world was void without any technologie materials, we see it , we feel it now it's having more than enough power to control the world. These technologies source are from one generation and took over the world. Have you ever wondering how poor people raised to a wealth state?! Simply through work. Some say if you can think it, then you can do it ;Yesss of course yess , Everything start into our mind. Have a thought to those great computers programmers what amazing things they did to keep the world in peace and a better place, to those inventors like Bill Gate , Steve Jobs and so on... Its all had a starting point. Now, let's have a look to a continent like Africa , some country still under pressure , some people still living without enough water , without having what we call symbiosis caused by lack of knowledge("My people perish because of lack of knowledge").Africa can be a better place , and from me: Africa will be a better place if we youth students and workers merge ideas together to fight the monster preventing us from moving forward. Some Africa people say and still doing it, Europeans are stealing Africa ressource and  everything in it.Well, WCC say no , it's a lie! We should stop accusing others and focus on the essential. Because when you know your thief you can fight against so that He/She stop stealing you. Right?! The question is how to fight against that monster?!!! :) So simple. Be a part of WCC! We will shut the monster down through the Will of God. Thank you very much for paying attention to our common fight.A list of WCC menbers will be generated latter when our blog will see how devoted are students and workers by their post and their ideas through theirs posts.Love you soooo much with an unconditional love.
